I'll be using IMGUI, no reason to use anything else.

I need to read more on ECS before thinking much about that, but I'll probably go with something like [Monocle's scene entity system](https://github.com/shortgecko/MonocleEngineMirror)
Don't need much at first and want to keep the bare minimum here, the first goal is the current scene's entities view where I can control positions and add/destroy instances

More explicit example on this architecture [here on nez documentation](https://github.com/prime31/Nez/blob/master/FAQs/Scene-Entity-Component.md)
